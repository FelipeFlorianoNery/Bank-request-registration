# Learning Project

## Introduction

This project is a simple console-based application in C that manages customer service requests. As I am in the process of learning and completing my education, this code serves as a practical exercise to implement basic functionalities.

## Getting Started

To run the application, you need to have a C compiler installed on your machine.

## Contributing
I am open to contributions from the community to enhance the code, improve existing features, or provide suggestions for better practices. If you have any ideas or improvements, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
